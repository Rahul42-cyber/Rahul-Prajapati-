    <h1>About Me – Rahul Prajapati</h1>

    <p>Hello and welcome! My name is <strong>Rahul Kr Prajapati</strong>, and I currently work as an <strong>Accountant</strong> at <strong>Global Textile Private Limited Company</strong>. I bring with me a strong work ethic, sharp focus, and a continuous drive to learn and grow — not just in accounting, but in various tech domains as well.</p>

    <p>I have always been passionate about technology. Over time, I’ve taken a deep interest in <strong>cybersecurity, ethical hacking, networking, and digital creativity</strong>. I actively learn through platforms like <strong>TryHackMe</strong>, and I’ve started working with tools such as <strong>Kali Linux, Nmap, Wireshark, and Burp Suite</strong>. These tools are helping me build real-world skills in cybersecurity, penetration testing, and system/network security.</p>

    <p>Besides cybersecurity, I also have a strong interest in <strong>video and photo editing</strong>. I love working with powerful creative tools like <strong>Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Premiere Pro, and After Effects</strong>. Editing allows me to express ideas visually and creatively — whether for social media, storytelling, or professional design work.</p>

    <p>What makes my journey unique is the balance I maintain between numbers and networks — between accounting and ethical hacking, between financial reports and digital visuals. I believe that in today’s world, a smart professional needs to have a <strong>mix of technical, creative, and practical thinking</strong>.</p>

    <p>My vision is to grow every day — to learn something new, improve existing skills, and stay open to fresh ideas. I’m not afraid of starting from scratch, and I value self-discipline, patience, and honest hard work.</p>

    <p>I also believe in sharing knowledge and learning with others. Whether it's helping someone solve a computer problem or guiding them on how to edit a video, I always enjoy being part of that learning journey. Collaboration and curiosity are at the heart of everything I do.</p>

    <p>In the future, I see myself growing into a <strong>multiskilled digital professional</strong> — someone who can manage accounts, build secure systems, and create engaging visual content — all with a calm, focused approach and a problem-solving mindset.</p>

    <p>Thank you so much for visiting this page and taking the time to get to know me. The journey is long, but every step counts — and I’m just getting started.</p>
